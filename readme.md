The program will ask user how many Kilometers they want to travel and their age.
Based on the given info, the program will then calculate the cost of the ticket, following these rules:
1. The base price is determined by the Km (0.21â‚¬ per Km);
2. Under 18 users will get a 20% discount;
3. Over 65 users will get a 40% discount;
